# Project 20 : Crowdfunding System

## Introcution 

Crowdfunding refers to the behavior of public individuals to use different internet technologiesand digital platforms in contributing and investing in project leaders, and innovators. This project is a gateway for fund providers, to contribute to the ﬁnancing of a promising project started by an innovative creator who lacks sufﬁcient resources for reifying. Also, one of itsmain roles is to create a link that will bridge the gap between viable project ideas and successfulimplementation.

## Objective

For the last few years, all over the world crowdfunding become one of the main tools and funding source for most of the new startups and creative minds all over the globe, so we sought to create a new crowdfunding application, that will bring and adopt all the creative minds and ambitious souls and provides them with a tool to seek funds from a global community, the creators should be able to coordinate multiple campaigns easier, and should be able to ﬁnd people who are willing to invest with little equity involved. And help in gate keeping that will monitor and create symbiotic relations with other algorithms and information online by using cloud-based solutions for better access. Our platform can help leap the hurdle of lack of experience in each ﬁeld. Letting the barrier of entry be lessened for everyone who has a dream.

## Main Actors

Different players are involved in crowdfunding models. First, there are creators, innovators,and entrepreneurs that have ideas and projects to be funded. They want to use crowdfunding to gather ﬁnancial support from interested supporters. Then there is the crowd of people that provides this ﬁnancial support to these projects, bearing an investment risk and expecting acertain payoff. And ﬁnally, there is the crowdfunding platform, the intermediary that acts as a matchmaker between those who want to deliver the new initiatives using crowdfunding mechanisms and those who want to support such initiatives through their investment efforts.

1. __Creator__: Or __capital seekers__, are mainly concerned with their motivations to get involved in crowdfunding, the determinants of success, and the legal restrictions of equity-based crowdfunding.

2. __Funder__: Or __capital providers__, are essential to the success of a crowdfunding campaign.Interesting research can be performed on the motives of this unique group of investors for participating in crowdfunding. One thing that makes this group so special is that they arenot exclusively motivated by earning money.
