# Project 15 : Online Banking Management System

## Objective / Vision

A bank can be defined as a financial institution which transacts its business in finance. It accepts deposits from the public and lends loan to those who are in need of it. It collects money, cheques, bills and drafts. There are many activities that take place in the banks. All these activities need to be kept in track. To keep track of all the activities that take place in the bank, the banking system project will be of great help. The details of the deposits, withdrawals, cheques, bills and many other details can be just got through one mouse click.

This application will help in reducing the pen paper work since most of the work can be done through the online mode. The work of the bank staffs will be reduced. The database at the back end must be strong since many details of the activities need to be stored. The user interface must be simple and easy to understand even by the common man. This will be one of the challenging and an interesting project idea that one can work on.
