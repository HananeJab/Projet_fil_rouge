# Project 9 : Food Ordering System

## Objective / Vision

The online food ordering system has a lot of scopes and we can tap it as far as we can as everyone has access to an online ordering facility through the internet.
In this project any person can order food online. It has two modules, admin and costumer/user.

## Functional Requirements

The system is basically for the users where they can add and also modify the orders. The users of the system include the customers where they can register initially with the minimum details and will be allowed to check the menu items before ordering them, adding them to the list and submit the order. The user of the system also includes vendor/admin who will handle a number of users (i.e. Customers) and info related to the product addition. They are also responsible for updating the menu items. All the activities such as adding the items, ordering them, etc. will be recorded in the database for all the events. For the more secure system, the login system is integrated. The system also supports payment methods and generates a bill that will initially help users to pay for their ordered items.
