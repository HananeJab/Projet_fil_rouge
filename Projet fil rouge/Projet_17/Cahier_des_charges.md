# Project 17 : Real estate using data mining

## Introduction 

Real estate industry has become a highly competitive business with an enormous amount of
unstructured documents and resources. The process of data mining in such a business provides an advantage to the developers by processing those data, predicting future trends
and helping them to make favorable knowledge-driven decisions.

## Objective / Vision

This project helps the users to make good decisions regarding buying or selling of valuable property. Prior to this online system this process involved a lot of travelling costs and searching time. Due to this system the user now does not have to travel much and can look for the property it is searching for, online according to its requirements. This system includes property details like Address, space measurement (sq ft), number of BHKs, Floor, Property Seller name and its contact number plus email-id. The user can search property depending on the area that it wants in, number of wash rooms, bedrooms, halls and kitchen. The system contains an algorithm that calculates loan that the user can take plus 20%-30% cash that the user has to pay. This system allows the admin to enter details about any property that it is wishing for. The admin can even delete the property details. Thus this system eliminates cost to a great extent and also reduces searching time. With the help of this system the user can get the property details depending on its preferences. Thus this system also helps to maintain good relationship between the buyers and the sellers of the property.
