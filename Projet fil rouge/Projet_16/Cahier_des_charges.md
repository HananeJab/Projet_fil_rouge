# Project 16 : Citizen Card System

## Abstract

The Project 'Citizen Card System' gives us the information about the citizen in any country. A Citizen has unique Id to find out the personal information in each and every department or service wherever a citizen goes. This information can be found out by the unique Id of the citizen. If any citizen wants to utilize the services or utilities by the Government or Private organizations, he has to go to each and every department with different Id for that particular department. Instead, a citizen card helps in having all the utilities and services under one unique Id.This system not only help us to know the information about the services or utilities but also it gives the information about the character of the citizen in credit rating.
